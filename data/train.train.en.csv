There should be no distinction in ""poor"" and ""reich"", and private property is largely handed over to the state. The so-called means of production such as buildings, utility areas and machines belong to everyone in common. (...) Thus, the thinker and philosopher Karl Marx, who counts as pioneers of communism, demanded that the exploitation of the workers by the increasingly rich ""capitalists"" should be put to an end. (...) He argued that there should be no more private property, but in an equal ""classless society"" everything should be declared to be shared property. (...)

Because in practice it currently looks like that the land and land belongings in the city privatize the revenues, but socialize costs (infrastructure, networks, public buildings etc.) by unfair taxation in Germany.

The apartments of the big corporations like ""German living"" or ""Vonovia"" are already much more expensive and these companies make millard profits annually, while the private individuals improve their pension, or their income for the most part. Of course, more apartments have to be built, the students don't even find any more WG rooms, smaller families have big problems, unless a family member works at the large automobile manufacturer from Wolfsburg. I have no idea of the matter, but I don't understand why the rents can go on rising, even though the profits are increasing. Free market sounds great, but the country has to manage and as soon as something is unfair or abnormal and we suffer from it, MUST the politics act, for that is the case, and the misconception of the rents would decrease, just because one builds more apartments, is a misconception. Private landlords must not suffer from the changes.",0,1,1

With the term conspiracy theory I would be careful to deal with, because many politicians who were formerly Marxists arrived in the middle of society. And also the question whether for much the state should step in, rather shows in the direction of statism. It would not be bad if a discussion programme were to take place in this direction. Then you can discuss controversially about such issues. I can see quite well that there is a need for clarification here.
